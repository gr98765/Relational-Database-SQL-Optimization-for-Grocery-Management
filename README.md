This is a relational database project modeled after a grocery retailer similar to Walmart Grocery.
It integrates real product data from the Walmart Grocery Product Dataset with synthetic customer, transaction, and pricing data to support inventory analytics, promotion tracking, and sales insights.

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of database design—from conceptual modeling to SQL implementation and analytical querying.

🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a robust, normalized MySQL database that can support typical grocery retail operations, such as:

Managing product, brand, category, and pricing information

Modeling customer, store, and transaction activity

Tracking promotional price changes

Analyzing sales trends and customer purchasing behavior

The project follows a structured sequence of deliverables:

ER Diagram & Entity Design

Relational Schema Conversion

Normalization (1NF → 3NF)

TBA
